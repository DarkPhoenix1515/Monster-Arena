THE BASICS OF THE TOOL:
EnviroSpawn is a tool that allows you to quickly populate large areas with objects.
It works on any surface, using raycasts.
Create an empty game object and go under Add Component > Enviro Spawn > EnviroSpawn.js.
then modify the variables to fit your needs.

HOW TO USE:
STEP 1: Under PREFABS select the amount of objects you want to be used and drag their prefabs.
STEP 2: Set DIMENSIONS to your preferred size.
STEP 3: Select LAYER MASK which will ignore all unwanted surfaces.
STEP 4: Set POPULATION (the amount of objects that you want to be generated inside the area).
STEP 5: Optional settings are OFFSET (which will determine the offset from the ground).
and FOLLOW NORMALS ORIENTATION (which will tell the objects to stay vertically or to follow the ground/normal orientation).
STEP 6: SCATTER MODE: Random/Fixed Grid/Even Spread - choose the way you want the prefabs to be positioned inside the chosen area.
-Fixed Grid: Instantiate the prefabs in a 1 unit * GridScale grid space. Starting from the bottom-left corner of the area and going left-to-right.
-Even Spread: Automatically calculating the grid intervals based on the dimensions and target population.

ADDITIONAL MODDING: 
If you feel like the tool is too performance heavy or you don't like the frequency of the updates go to EnviroSpawn.js and change line 21 "private var updateSkip : int = ".
0 = update every frame; 4 = skip every 3 updates; (and so on)
